# Programming-Principles-and-Practice-Using-Cpp
This is the support code for Stroustrup book: "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (Second Edition)". 

I modified the code on his website so that it compiles on modern operating systems and compilers.

Compilation and code has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04.1 and Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11.6).
